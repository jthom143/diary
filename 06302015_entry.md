Yesterday: Completed figures for seasonal SAM analysis including: 
* DJF-JJA Joint Probabilities (now with same colorbar axes). 
* DJF-JJA Scatter Plots with correlation values
* Correlation of DJF with other seasons (JJA, SON, MAM) for SAM TRENDS
* Correlation of DJF with other seasons for SAM (i.e. climatologies).
